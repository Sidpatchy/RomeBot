# RomeBot by Sidpatchy
> Why does this branch exist?

Discord.py is no longer being developed, as a result, RomeBot will no longer be developed using Discord.py.

> What is changing?

RomeBot will be migrating to Javacord.f

There are some minor tweaks to how things are formatted, but the biggest change is the removal of "old fashioned" commands in favour of slash commands. I am building the bot in a way that adding "old fashioned" commands would be relatively easy, but as it stands, I see no real reason to put development time into something that is being deprecated by Discord.

> What's taking so long? Why aren't you commiting to the repo periodically like normal?

I've been quite busy with work as of late and have't had the time nor motivation to develop RomeBot. Additionally, it seems every time I touch it, I end up rewriting large amounts of what I *have* done because I found some better way to achieve what I wanted. I have a minimally working version of the bot as it stands, however, the bot isn't up to the standard I hold quite yet.
