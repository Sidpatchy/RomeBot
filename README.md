# RomeBot by Sidpatchy
Get Started By Typing !help

RomeBot is a basic chat bot I created it to bring some more fun to my Discord Server, and... who doesn't need the Glory of Rome in everything they do?

Now including 36% more glory in the same package! Nowhere else can you find so much glory packed into such a small package. Only 471.5 kilobytes!

Remember, Roma Invicta and Carthago Delanda Est!

I have no plans for new features but I will add them as I see fit

Written in Python using version 3.8.x using Discord.py; RomeBot always uses the most recent version of Python.

To host this bot you must have discord.py, asyncio, and PyYAML installed. Alternatively, you can invite it to your Discord server using this link: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/511050489928876052
