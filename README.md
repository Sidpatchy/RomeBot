The only Discord bot dedicated to the everlasting Glory of Rome.

## Status
I've thought about this for a while, and finally concluded that RomeBot, while being surprisingly successful, is not a project I wish to continue actively maintaining any longer. I haven't been hosting the bot for a number of months, and its original purpose has been served.

Prior to RomeBot, I barely knew how to code. My previous projects were pretty much exclusively comprised of me spending days upon days hacking together barely working C++ code on an Arduino. I didn't understand the code. RomeBot was where that changed, it's what lead me to the point I'm at now. When I started learning Java, RomeBot served to teach me how it worked.

So with that, RomeBot's life as a standalone Discord bot is over. Perhaps someday, when I get around to writing the ClaireBot plugins API, RomeBot will make a comeback.

Contributions will not be ignored.

## Getting Started
RomeBot can be invited to a server using (put link here). Just use /help to get started!

If you'd like, RomeBot can be easily self-hosted using one of pre-built binaries which can be found on the 
[releases](https://github.com/Sidpatchy/RomeBot/releases) tab. Otherwise, potentially unstable development builds can be
found on my [Jenkins](https://ci.sidpatchy.com/job/RomeBot/).

RomeBot is written with Java 11 source compatability, but it is highly recommended to use Java 17 as all testing is
performed using Java 17 (specifically the Temurin 17 JDK).

## About
RomeBot has been in continuous development since 2018 and is written in Java as of RomeBot 3 using Javacord.

## Previous Versions
With RomeBot 3, RomeBot's licence has been updated to the GPLv3. RomeBot's previous versions are ideally not used, 
however, if you want to use or modify one of them for any reason they are still licenced under the much more permissive
MIT licence. They can be found by selecting the [version 1](https://github.com/Sidpatchy/RomeBot/tree/Version-1) or
[version 2](https://github.com/Sidpatchy/RomeBot/tree/Version-2) branches.
