# RomeBot by Sidpatchy
> Why the rewrite?

Discord.py is no longer being developed, as a result, RomeBot will no longer be developed using Discord.py.

> Why'd you pick Java?

I find java to be a fun language to work with. 

> What is changing?

RomeBot will be migrating to Javacord.

There are some minor tweaks to how things are formatted, but the biggest change is the removal of "old fashioned" commands in favour of slash commands. I am building the bot in a way that adding "old fashioned" commands would be relatively easy, but as it stands, I see no real reason to put development time into something that is being deprecated by Discord.

Additionally, new releases of RomeBot will be licensed under the GPLv3.
